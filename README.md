ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

proGEN is an open-source framework for the procedural generation of finite element analysis (FEA) models of bridges using the Python 3 language. It utilizes the program ... as the FE solver while proGEN acts as pre- and post- processor. proGEN is written and maintained by David Masceri and Nick Romano at Rutgers University.

The proGEN project is based on the RAMPS software library for Matlab written at Drexel University by David Masceri, Nick Romano, and John Braley. The proGEN project is also based on code developed as part of the apish library for Matlab written by John Braley and John DeVitis as Rutgers University.

The source code for the project may be accessed at...
